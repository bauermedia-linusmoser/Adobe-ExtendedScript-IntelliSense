# Types for Adobe - Visual Studio Code IntelliSense for Adobe CEP Panel Projects

This is a fork of the [Types-for-Adobe](https://github.com/pravdomil/Types-for-Adobe) repository by [pravdomil](https://github.com/pravdomil). While the original repo is focussed on installing all typings (via npm) for the usage with TypeScript, this fork focusses on the usage with regular JavaScript for the creation of Adobe CEP panels.

It is possible to enhance the Visual Studio Code IntelliSense with the provided TypeScript declaration files, while using regular JavaScript.

## Usage with Visual Studio Code
### 1. Download all necessary files
### 2. Create a `settings.json`
### 3. Create a `tsconfig.json`
